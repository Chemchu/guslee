# Depressing stuff

This game is just.. pure Silent Hill hellish stuff. James is weird as hell, Eddy
is weird as hell, Angela suffered way too much, Maria is super creepy sometimes.
This game is a big punishment for James. What he did was wrong and he lowkey
deserved it. Laura is okay tho, little annoying kid
