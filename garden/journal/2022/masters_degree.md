# I learned nothing there

Honestly? I did not learn a single practical thing there. All of the stuff we
saw were academical stuff. That makes sense, master's are usually the step
before a PhD. All of the things we saw were headed to that direction, so yeah.
Nothing practical for a guy that needs to get a job as soon as possible and eat.
