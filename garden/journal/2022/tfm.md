# ERPSolution, my beloved

Here I went full in monkey mode. I miss the free time I used to have back then.
I went maniac, using almost all of my time into that project. I made a full web
ERP system from scratch. I used a mix of different tech I wanted to try, like Go
and Docker. yes, Docker, even that was new to me. I even tried Rust back then
and had to leave it because it was too hard for me at that time. Don't worry, I
am pretty good at Rust nowadays.

So, I created and deployed my ERP system in a local convenience store in
Valencia. They used my system for everything. Invoices, prices, bar code
printing, logging in and out, statistics and much more. Honestly, that was the
biggest piece of software I have ever made. I don't usually think about it that
much, but in retrospective, I am pretty proud of what I accomplished. That code
is now obsolete. I was done with React 14 and NextJS. It's sad to think that all
of that code is filled with vulnerabilities from node packages and
broken/deprecated software. To maintain that would have been too much, honestly.

I got a 10/10 score. Matricula de honor is what we call that in Spain. No idea
what is the equivalent in english speaking countries
