# Not unemployed anymore

So, I got the call. After finishing my interviews, I had to wait two full weeks
to know if they were going to hire me or not. And they hired me. Informatica is
the place. It is an american company with +5000 employees. I now know that they
were looking for just two new hires. I think they narrowed the possible hires to
5 candidates, 2 of whom were my coworker Karolina and I. Nice! Got the job, now
I can finally save some money
