# Living in Kilbarrack

Oh my fucking god that was fucking awful. I lived with 11 different human beings
in the same house. The housing crisis in Ireland is HUGE. How is that even
legal? My house was split in two. In the main section were 12 people trying to
live. In the second smaller section were 5 people. That's just fucking crazy. By
the way, it was not even close to cheap. I paid 850€ per month. That's almost a
full month income in Spain. Yeah, Kilbarrack was harsh. I am glad I am not there
anymore tho
