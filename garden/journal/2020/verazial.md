# First job as an intern

So, I got paid internship. That's rare, specially in Spain. Most of my friend
had unpaid internship. It's important to say that I only got paid because I was
studying at UPV and they were studying at UV. I guess engineers are a big deal
for companies. I got paid 900€/month tho. That was harsh but I did learn a lot.
