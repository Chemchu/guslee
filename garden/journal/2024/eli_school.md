# ELI School

It was fun! Everyone there was amazing. I won an Oscar for best starring actor
(this is not a joke). The teacher loved me, the students loved me. I even went
on a gay date with one of the heads of the school. Please don't ask me about it.
I thought he only wanted to talk but we ended up having Tiramisu in a romantic
italian restaurant. Bea still jokes around about that. Oh man
