# I love her so much

We met back in 2019. I think it was November. She talked to me first, which is
crazy because she was and is way out of my league. I got myself into one of her
lessons about animation. Everybode knew I was not from there. That I was an
outsider. Even the teacher knew but he was okay with that. That rocks. She asked
my friend about me. She said "¿no nos lo vas a presentar?". What a woman,
honestly.

A lot of things happened until now, and I don't regret a single thing. She is
the best thing in my life. I love her very very much
