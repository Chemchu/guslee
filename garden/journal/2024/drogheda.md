# Drogheda

So, pretty small town. Cool people tho, I met a lot of people. There was this
old mexican lady trying to have her way with me. I had to share house with her
(and more people) and it was really uncomfortable because she would not leave me
alone. Always joking around with sexual stuff and trying to touch me ugh,
disgusting. Bea really hates that woman. Good thing I never saw her again.
