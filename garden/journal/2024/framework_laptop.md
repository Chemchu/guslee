# The Framework Laptop

What an amazing piece of hardware. I am writing this blog on it right now. Super
amazing, flexible, and repairable. I got myself a broken display. I asked them
for a replacement and BOOM. There it was. I replaced it myself and it works just
fine. I love this laptop. Surely is the best purchase I've ever done. Of course
I am not running Windows like a complete loser. I am on NixOS and I am not
turning back anytime soon. Maybe I'll try Arch again. Who knows
