# I quit

I left my former company because of a lot of things. The project was a mess, my
salary was a joke. It was 21500€/year which rounds up to ~1400€/month, which is
basically nothing. I learned 0 things. I had to solve and help everyone
constantly. I felt really loved by my coworkers. They respected me and I
respected them. The team assigned to that project (Waternology) was a pretty
solid team. It's a shame how everything ended but that's life.
