# Welcome to my website

So, you found my website. Probably in Twitter or LinkedIn, right? Yeah,
probably.

Let me give you a small introduction to this... place. This blog/website, or
whatever you wanna call it, is basically a brain dump of all the stuff I know
about anything with no particular order or correctness. There's this concept in
the world wide web called
[digital garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/05+-+Concepts/A+Brief+History+and+Ethos+of+the+Digital+Garden)
and I am making one of those right here right now.

What is that you mean? Well, basically a Digital Garden is:

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by
> their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked
> through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are
> published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.
> They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal
> websites we're used to seeing.

## My little digital garden

I started this project after getting stuck with my previous website attempts. I
tried quite hard to create a beautiful eye-catching website with amazing fonts
and animations. I really thought that it was going to be easy to create one of
those jaw-dropping websites like
[Patrick's incredible portfolio](https://bepatrickdavid.com/) in one month. I
was really wrong about that.

You need to know one thing about be: Professionally, I am a fullstack engineer.
But at heart, I'll always be a backend engineer.

I know CSS and HTML, of course. But I don't know how to make visually stunning
effects with that. I made an ERP from scratch back in 2020, but that required
only some HTML forms and a lot of backend code. No animations, no beautiful
fonts, no nothing. It was fun tho.

Here I crafted a lovely search bar with some posts. You can search for anything
you want in there. I indexed the posts titles AND contents. Because of that, you
are able to make a full-text search through my knowledge network. You are
welcome, btw.
