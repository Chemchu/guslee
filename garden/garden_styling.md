# My styling notes

Here I post all the styling things I find interesting about my digital garden.
I'll add a history change here as well. Just to keep a record of the changes and
to avoid repeating styles.

I wanted to make this blog site stand out more but honestly I am not that good
at designing stuff. I may be an amazing fullstack engineer, but really, I truly
feel more comfortable working as a backend engineer. What can I say, there's a
hidden beauty in not dealing with CSS shenanigans. That's why I made this blog
site using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). For
more info just go to my [welcome post](welcome)

See you around!
